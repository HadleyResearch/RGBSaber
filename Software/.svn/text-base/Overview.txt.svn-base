Long Long Ago (4 years) in a Movie Theater not so far away, George Lucas brought out his latest and final installment to the Star Wars saga: Revenge of the Sith. Around that time, all sorts of merchandise came out, the coolest of which was the ForceFX lightsaber: http://media.techeblog.com/images/fx.jpg

Like many fans, it wasn't long before I got my hands on one of the ForceFX lightsabers (a red Darth Vader one). The saber came with instructions explaining that it was not a toy and therefore not meant to be played with. I went ahead and disregarded those instructions, it was too much fun to just have it sit on a display case.

The saber worked quite well for some time (2 years or so), but eventually I had pushed it to it's mass-manufactured limit
