Description: 
    This file contains instructions for users and developers to help navigate
  the standard NBitWonder project hierarchy. Instructions are provided 
  concerning what the specified directory hierarchy contains and what files 
  should be included.

Current Location: RGBSaber/
Description of hierarchy:
    This is the root directory of the current project. This directory contains
the file README.txt containing project-specific information and should be
updated from default values to reflect your project.
    In addition to the README.txt file, this directory contains a number of 
folders corresponding to the various aspects of the project:
    
    Electronics   :: Electrical schematics and CAD files for the project
    Mechanical    :: CAD, Mechanical designs, and related project source files
    Firmware      :: Embedded software for the project (microcontroller code,
                       FPGA/CPLD files, memory images, etc.)
    Software      :: PC/Desktop software, drivers, software tools, etc. (used
                       for interfacing to a project but not directly run on the
                       hardware itself)
    Simulation    :: Circuit simulations, 3D renderings, mathematical
                       simulations of various aspects of the project
    Documentation :: Documentation files for project

    For any components of the project not in use, feel free to remove the file
hierarchies.
