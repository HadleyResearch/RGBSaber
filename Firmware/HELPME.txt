Description: This file contains instructions for users and developers to help
    navigate the standard NBitWonder project hierarchy. Instructions are
    provided concerning what the specified directory hierarchy contains and
    what files should be included.

Current Location: RGBSaber/Firmware
Description of hierarchy:
    The Firmware hierarchy contains any and all embedded firmware utilized in
your project. Firmware is any and all code utilized by embedded electronics
(microcontroller code, FPGA/CPLD source code, memory images or databases), but
DOES NOT include PC or server-side software such as tools, utilities, drivers,
graphical user interfaces, etc. -- these items are placed in the 'Software'
hierarchy.
    The Firmware hierarchy contains separate sub-hierarchies for each version
of the project firmware. NBitWonder versioning starts at 1.0, adding 1 for 
major versions and 0.1 for minor versions. All versions are contained in the
toplevel Firmware hierarchy (1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 2.0, 2.1, etc.). If the project is
large (i.e. many minor versions for each major version), consider placing major
versions at the Firmware toplevel and minor versions in sub-hierarchies. Within
each hierarchy include separate folders for microcontroller code, fpga code,
cpld code, memory images, etc.
