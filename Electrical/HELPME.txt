File: HELPME.txt
Description: This file contains instructions for users and developers to help
    navigate the standard NBitWonder project hierarchy. Instructions are
    provided concerning what the specified directory hierarchy contains and
    what files should be included.

Current Location: RGBSaber/Electrical
Description of hierarchy:
    This hierarchy contains relevant files for the electrical design of the
project. Design files are separated into components -- portions of the design
that are all co-located on a single printed circuit board. Should your design
contain multiple components, such as daughterboards, independent motor drivers,
power supplies, etc., each component should contain its own folder within
<project_root>/Electronics. 
    Each design component hierarchy should contain separate folders for each 
version of the component. NBitWonder project versioning begins at 1.0, 
incrementing by 1 for major versions and 0.1 for minor versions. If the project
is a large project (many minor versions for each major version), consider 
grouping minor versions under shared major version hierarchies.
